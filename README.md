## How to Run `ME Ranking.py`

1. Install Python packages: `openpyxl`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `jupyter`.
2. Open the notebook `ME Ranking 2024_XGBoost_2025_19_4 1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook (or execute it with `jupyter nbconvert --execute`).
3. Run all cells sequentially. The final cell trains an improved neural network model and prints its accuracy, AUC, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Make sure the dataset `ME & IE Department Data.xlsx` is placed in the project root before running the notebook.
